<h1 align="center">‚ö° Alby - Lightning Browser Extension</h1>
<p align="center">
  <strong>Seamlessly bring Bitcoin's Lightning Network to your browser.</strong>
</p>

The Alby browser extension seamlessly integrates the Bitcoin Lightning Network into websites, enabling both payments and authentication flows.

Designed to be a lightweight and efficient web extension, Alby allows browsers to interact with the Lightning Network programmatically. It focuses on web payments rather than advanced node management, ensuring a simple and intuitive user experience.

Alby implements the WebLN standard, providing a universal interface for websites to:

- Connect to Lightning Network nodes
- Request payments, invoices, signatures, and logins
- Enable a smooth and frictionless web payment experience
- The extension supports both custodial and non-custodial setups, making it flexible for different use cases

## üåü Key Features

- **Custom Budgets & Allowances** - Enable auto-payments and payment streams.
- **Multiple Accounts** - Supports different Lightning node backends (e.g., LND, CLN, custodial options).
- **Full WebLN Support** - Send & receive payments, generate invoices, signMessage, verifyMessage, dynamic makeInvoice and more.
- **LNURL Support** - Seamless [LNURL-pay](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/06.md), [LNURL-auth](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/04.md), and [LNURL-withdraw](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/03.md) integrations.
- **Keysend Payments** - Send payments without an invoice.
- **Payment History & Metadata** - Track transactions with additional website metadata.

## ü§ù Native Companions

Alby supports native connectors to native applications on the host computer. For this, the extension passes each call to a native application (using [native messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging)).
This allows Alby also to connect to nodes behind Tor (through this native "proxy" application).

Currently, there is one native companion app available to connect to Tor nodes: [https://github.com/getAlby/alby-companion-rs](https://github.com/getAlby/alby-companion-rs)

## ‚ùî FAQs

#### Why not use Joule?

Joule is a full interface to manage a LND node. It only supports one LND account.
Our goal is NOT to write a full UI for a Lightning Network node with all the channel management features, but instead to only focus on what is necessary for the web (for payment and authentication flows). We believe there are already way better management UIs.
Also, we focus on supporting multiple different node backends (non-custodial and custodial).

#### What is WebLN?

WebLN is a library and set of specifications for lightning apps and client providers to facilitate communication between apps and users' lightning nodes in a secure way. It provides a programmatic, permissioned interface for letting applications ask users to send payments, generate invoices to receive payments, and much more. [This documentation](https://webln.guide/) covers how to use WebLN in your Lightning-driven applications.
