# Lightning Browser Extension

### A browser extension to bring the Bitcoin Lightning Network to the browser

The extension provides deep Lightning Network integration for websites (for payments and authentication flows).

The goal is to write a minimal web extension to allow browsers to interact with the Lightning Network programmatically. It focuses on the web-payments process and does not try to be a full node UI with advanced channel-management or similar features.

The extension implements the WebLN standard as the interface that allows websites to connect to Lightning Network nodes (to request payments, invoices, signatures, login, etc.) and enable seamless UX of web payments and authentications.

The extension can connect to different node implementations and supports custodial and non-custodial setups.

## Some Features

- [x] Custom budgets/allowances for websites to allow payment streams/auto-payments
- [x] Multiple accounts and support for different node backends (lnd, etc.)
- [x] Full WebLN send and receive payment flows (getInfo, sendPayment, fixed makeInvoice support)
- [x] [LNURL-pay](https://xn--57h.bigsun.xyz/lnurl-pay-flow.txt) support
- [x] [LNURL-auth](https://xn--57h.bigsun.xyz/lnurl-auth.html) support
- [x] Payment history with additional website metadata
- [x] [LNURL-withdraw](https://xn--57h.bigsun.xyz/lnurl-withdraw-flow.txt) support
- [x] WebLN signMessage, verifyMessage support
- [x] WebLN dynamic makeInvoice support
- [x] Keysend
- [ ] [Lsat](https://lsat.tech/) support

- To watch file changes in development

  - Chrome
    - `yarn run dev:chrome`
  - Firefox
    - `yarn run dev:firefox`
  - Opera

#### Testnet/testing-accounts for development

We set up our own internal testnet, which can be used for your development.  
If this is not reachable please let us know.

- [Test-setup](https://github.com/getAlby/lightning-browser-extension/wiki/Test-setup) for different connectors (i.e. LND)
- [RTL](https://rtl.regtest.getalby.com) for testing nodes (PW: `getalby`)
  Currently only lists LND nodes
- [LNDhub.go API Swagger](https://lndhub.regtest.getalby.com/swagger/index.html)

#### Storybook.js

We have a working [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)-setup and some components have stories.  
You can find the deployed Storybook here: https://lbe-stories.netlify.app

### :heavy_check_mark: Tests

#### E2E tests via [playwright](https://playwright.dev) ([using testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/pptr-testing-library/intro/))

```bash
yarn run dev:chrome
yarn test:e2e
```

:tipping_hand_woman: For now we only do E2E tests for Chrome

#### Unit tests tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io)

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

#### Run all tests

```bash
yarn test
```

### üíª Load extension into browser

- **Chrome**

  - Go to the browser address bar and type `chrome://extensions`
  - Check the `Developer Mode` button to enable it.
  - Click on the `Load Unpacked Extension‚Ä¶` button.
  - Select the extension‚Äôs dist directory: `dist/development/chrome`
  - To see the debug console check the `inspect views` in the extension details

- **Firefox**

  - Load the Add-on via `about:debugging` => `This Firefox` as temporary Add-on. (`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`)
  - Choose a .xpi file or the `manifest.json` file in the extension's dist directory: `dist/development/firefox`
  - [debugging details](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/debugging/#debugging_popups)
  - To see the debug console click "inspect" on the list of temporary extensions (`about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`)

- **Opera**

  - Load the extension via `opera:extensions`
  - Check the `Developer Mode` and load as unpacked from extension‚Äôs extracted directory.

To connect to a remote development LND node you can use a [test account](https://github.com/bumi/lightning-browser-extension/wiki/Test-setup)

### Debugging

Most logs are written to the background script. Make sure to "inspect" the background script to see the console. Help for [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/tut_debugging/), [Firefox](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/debugging/)

### ‚å®Ô∏è Production package files

- `yarn run package` builds the extension for all the browsers to `dist/production` directory respectively.

You can also use a Docker container and run the yarn commands within a container:

```bash
docker run --rm --volume="$(pwd):/app" --workdir="/app" -t -i node:lts "yarn install && yarn run package"
```

Note: By default the `manifest.json` is set with version `0.0.0`. The webpack loader will update the version in the build with that of the `package.json` version. In order to release a new version, update version in `package.json` and run script.

## Native Companions

Alby supports native connectors to native applications on the host computer. For this the extension passes each call to a native application (using [native messaging](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging)).
This allows Alby also to connect to nodes behind Tor (through this native "proxy" application).

Currently, there is one native companion app available to connect to Tor nodes: [https://github.com/getAlby/alby-companion-rs](https://github.com/getAlby/alby-companion-rs)

### Creating a PR

When creating a PR please take this points as a reminder:

- Not too big
- Try to split things up
- Think in iterations (babysteps)  
  You can always start a PR and if you feel like adding on more things to it, better branch off and create a new i.e. _draft_-PR
- Newly added components should have a unit-test
- If there's not yet an issue for your PR please first [create an issue](https://github.com/bumi/lightning-browser-extension/issues/new) with a proposal what you would like to do. This allows us to give feedback and helps you no wasting time and motivation
- If you work on a more complex PR please [join our community chat](https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/archives/C02591ADXM2) to get feedback, discuss the best way to tackle the challenge, and to ensure that there's no duplication of work. It's often faster and nicer to chat or call about questions than to do ping-pong comments in PRs

## ‚ùî FAQs

#### Why not use Joule?

Joule is a full interface to manage a LND node. It only supports one LND account.
Our goal is NOT to write a full UI for a Lightning Network node with all the channel management features, but instead to only focus on what is necessary for the web (for payment and authentication flows). We believe there are already way better management UIs.
Also we focus on supporting multipe different node backends (non-custodial and custodial).

#### What is WebLN?

WebLN is a library and set of specifications for lightning apps and client providers to facilitate communication between apps and users' lightning nodes in a secure way. It provides a programmatic, permissioned interface for letting applications ask users to send payments, generate invoices to receive payments, and much more. [This documentation](https://webln.dev/#/) covers how to use WebLN in your Lightning-driven applications.

#### Is there a bounty program and can I contribute?

Yes. Thanks to generous donors, Alby is able to offer several bounties. You can find them on our [Wiki page](https://github.com/getAlby/lightning-browser-extension/wiki/Bounties). If you want to support Alby's bounty program, please donate [here](https://getalby.com/bounties). We greatly appreciate your contribution! üôè
